### About Me

I am a Master's student in Physics at LMU Munich with a strong foundation in **quantum information theory** and hands-on research experience. My current work at **Fraunhofer AISEC** involves developing and implementing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for machine learning, with direct applications in cybersecurity.

I am proficient in quantum computing frameworks like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane** and am actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in **quantum algorithms** and research.

### 🔬 Research & Work Experience

I am passionate about applying theoretical concepts to practical problems. My current and past work includes:

* **Working Student (Quantum Algorithms) @ Fraunhofer AISEC:**
    * Developing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for optimization and risk assessment in cybersecurity.
    * Implementing data-driven simulations using Python, Qiskit, and PennyLane.
    * *(Note: The code for this work is proprietary. See my [project summary repository](#-key-projects) for a detailed overview of the methodologies and skills applied.)*

* **Summer Research Intern @ Queen's University Belfast:**
    * Investigated stochastic processes and Markov models in quantum measurement theory.
    * Utilized Monte Carlo simulations to analyze noise effects on quantum systems.
